- include variable value to script

ECHO
- echo text to console

- take the field values first row to the variables

- execute operations if condition true

FOR SELECT <Select query> ;

- execute operations for each rows

/*:<Variable name>*/
<DML operator>
- run DML operator and set processed row count to variable

Example script with variable var.RunVar=DEMO:
IF '{RunVar}' = 'DEMO';
  ECHO RunVar has value: {RunVar}
